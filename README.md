### YQL(Yet another-Query-Language)
YQL is very similar with the `where` part of sql. It is designed for rule engine in didi. You can regard it as a sql which also support comparison between two sets. YQL have little concepts and you can use it well short after reading the examples.

	result := yql.Match(rawYQL, map[string]interface{}{
		"name":  "deen",
		"age":   int64(23),
		"hobby": "basketball",
		"score": int64(100),
	})
	fmt.Println(result)
	rawYQL = `score ∩ (7,1,9,5,3)`
	result = yql.Match(rawYQL, map[string]interface{}{
		"score": []int64{3, 100, 200},
	})
	fmt.Println(result)
	rawYQL = `score in (7,1,9,5,3)`
	result = yql.Match(rawYQL, map[string]interface{}{
		"score": []int64{3, 5, 2},
	})
	fmt.Println(result)
	//Output:
	//true
	//true
